### Get started

CDN:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/chota">
```

npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install chota
```

#### SASS support
Chota is designed keeping in mind *ease-of-use* and *minimalism*, hence it doesn't use any preprocessor or complex build process. If you would still like to extend it further using SASS, head to [palmiak's fork](https://github.com/palmiak/chota).
